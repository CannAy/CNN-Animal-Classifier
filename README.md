# CNN Model for Animal Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of 10 animal species. The goal was to build and evaluate a model that can effectively identify different animal classes from images. While the project successfully delivered a functional model, the final results indicate room for improvement in both model design and data handling.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Animals with Attributes 2
- **Classes:** 10 animal species (e.g., collie, dolphin, elephant, polar bear, etc.)
- **Image Preprocessing:** All images were resized to 128x128.
- **Train/Test Split:** 70% training, 30% testing.
- **Augmentation:** Basic techniques like rotation and blurring were applied. Advanced augmentation (e.g., flipping, brightness adjustment) was not implemented due to time constraints.

## Model Architecture
- **Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Layers:**
  - 3 convolutional layers (with 32, 64, and 128 filters respectively).
  - 3 max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
  - 1 fully connected layer with 256 neurons.
  - Dropout layer with a rate of 50% to prevent overfitting.
  - Final dense layer for 10-class classification.
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Total Parameters:** ~6.5 million

## Observations
### Why Are the Results Low?
- **Overfitting:** The model performed well on the training data but struggled to generalize on the validation and test data.
- **Limited Data Augmentation:** Only basic augmentation techniques were applied, leading to a lack of diversity in the training data.
- **Model Complexity:** With over 6.5 million parameters, the model may be too large for the given dataset.
- **Dataset Size:** Each class contained only 650 images. For a model with this level of complexity, the dataset size was insufficient.

### What Could Have Been Done Better?
1. **Advanced Data Augmentation:**
   Techniques like flipping, zooming, brightness adjustment, and shifting could have provided the model with more diverse data, improving generalization.
2. **Simpler Model Design:**
   Reducing the number of filters and the size of the fully connected layers could have mitigated overfitting and made the model more efficient.
3. **Transfer Learning:**
   Utilizing a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet or VGG16) could have leveraged already-learned features and boosted accuracy with limited data.
4. **Longer Training:**
   Increasing the number of epochs and using learning rate scheduling might have allowed the model to converge better.

## Recommendations
### For Future Improvements:
1. **Enhance Data Augmentation:**
   - Add brightness, contrast, flipping, and zoom transformations.
2. **Reduce Model Complexity:**
   - Use fewer filters in convolutional layers (e.g., 16, 32, 64).
   - Reduce the number of dense layer neurons.
3. **Use Pretrained Models:**
   - Fine-tune a model like ResNet50 or VGG16 with the current dataset.
4. **Extend Training:**
   - Increase the number of epochs and monitor learning using callbacks like `ReduceLROnPlateau`.

### Expected Benefits:
- **Improved Generalization:** Data augmentation and a simpler model would help the model perform better on unseen data.
- **Faster Training:** A smaller model would require less computational power and train faster.
- **Higher Accuracy:** Pretrained models would provide a significant performance boost with minimal effort.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into CNN model design and its challenges with limited data. While the model achieved a modest accuracy, there is considerable room for improvement through better data handling, model design, and advanced techniques like transfer learning.
